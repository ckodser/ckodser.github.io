I have wanted to be a researcher since middle school, fascinated with mathematics problems. I followed my interest in high school by attending the computer science olympiad, which led to my silver medal in International Olympiad in Informatics. Further, by majoring in computer engineering, I joined Dr. Rohab Lab. With this Lab (Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab), I published a paper in NeurIPS 2022 about OOD detection and adversarial training.

I also continue my algorithmic interest by joining the national olympiad of the informatic committee and contributing to the national olympiad in various positions. These positions include but are not limited to summer camp principal graph lecturer (2021), leader of algorithmic problem creation team for national team selection contests (2021, 2020), and leader of algorithmic problem creation team for national summer camp in informatics (2020, 2019).
