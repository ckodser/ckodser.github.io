I have wanted to be a researcher since middle school, fascinated by mathematical problems
and intrigued by challenges. I pursued my interest further in high school by participating
in the computer science olympiad, which led to my earning a silver medal in the International
Olympiad in Informatics and participating in ICPC world final.

I also continued to nurture my algorithmic interests by joining the National Olympiad
in Informatics committee as a member,  contributing to the national olympiad in various capacities.
These roles include, but are not limited to, serving as the
summer camp principal graph lecturer (2021),
leading the algorithmic problem design team for national team selection contests (2021, 2020),
and heading the algorithmic problem design team for the national summer camp in informatics (2020, 2019).

Furthering my education, I majored in computer engineering and joined Dr. Rohban's Lab.
In this lab (Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab), I worked
on adversarially robust Out-of-Distribution detection.
This is not my only venture in the lab. Later I did an internship at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria) under the mentorship of Professor Dan Alistarh, and worked on the utilization of sparsity to enhance interpretability.

I started my PhD in University of Maryland under supervision of Professor Soheil Feizi and MohammadTaghi HajiAghayi. I'm working on reasoning LLMs with Soheil and automatic theorem proving with MohammadTaghi.
