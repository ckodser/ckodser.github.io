Although OOD detection methods have advanced by a great deal, they are still susceptible to adversarial examples, which is a violation of their purpose. To mitigate this issue, several defenses have recently been proposed. Nevertheless, these efforts remained ineffective, as their evaluations are based on either small perturbation sizes, or weak attacks. In this work, we re-examine these defenses against an end-to-end PGD attack on in/out data with larger perturbation sizes, e.g. up to commonly used for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Surprisingly, almost all of these defenses perform worse than a random detection under the adversarial setting. Next, we aim to provide a robust OOD detection method. In an ideal defense, the training should expose the model to almost \it all possible adversarial perturbations, which can be achieved through adversarial training. That is, such training perturbations should based on both in- and out-of-distribution samples. Therefore, unlike OOD detection in the standard setting, access to OOD, as well as in-distribution, samples sounds necessary in the adversarial training setup. These tips lead us to adopt generative OOD detection methods, such as OpenGAN, as a baseline. We subsequently propose the Adversarially Trained Discriminator (ATD), which utilizes a pre-trained robust model to extract robust features, and a generator model to create OOD samples. We noted that, for the sake of training stability, in the adversarial training of the discriminator, one should attack real in-distribution as well as real outliers, but not generated outliers. Using ATD with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as the in-distribution data, we could significantly outperform all previous methods in the robust AUROC while maintaining high standard AUROC and classification accuracy. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="moakhar2023spade" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">SPADE: Sparsity-Guided Debugging for Deep Neural Networks. <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/33092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(ICML)</a> </div> <div class="author"> Arshia Soltani Moakhar*, Eugenia Iofinova*, Elias Frantar, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Towards this goal, multiple tools have been proposed to aid a human examiner in reasoning about a network’s behavior in general or on a set of instances. However, the outputs of these tools-such as input saliency maps or neuron visualizations-are frequently difficult for a human to interpret, or even misleading, due, in particular, to the fact that neurons can be multifaceted, i.e., a single neuron can be associated with multiple distinct feature combinations. In this paper, we present a new general approach to address this problem, called SPADE, which, given a trained model and a target sample, uses sample-targeted pruning to provide a "trace" of the network’s execution on the sample, reducing the network to the connections that are most relevant to the specific prediction. We demonstrate that preprocessing with SPADE significantly increases both the accuracy of image saliency maps across several interpretability methods and the usefulness of neuron visualizations, aiding humans in reasoning about network behavior. Our findings show that sample-specific pruning of connections can disentangle multifaceted neurons, leading to consistently improved interpretability. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="rodeo" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">RODEO: Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection Via Exposing Adaptive Outliers. <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/32673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> (ICML)</a> </div> <div class="author"> Hossein Mirzaei, Mohammad Jafari, Hamid Reza Dehbashi, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 6 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '6 more authors' ?

While there has been tremendous improvement in various variants of OOD detection in recent years, detection performance under adversarial settings lags far behind the performance in the standard setting. In order to bridge this gap, we introduce RODEO in this paper, a data-centric approach that generates effective outliers for robust OOD detection. More specifically, we first show that targeting the classification of adversarially perturbed in- and out-of-distribution samples through outlier exposure (OE) could be an effective strategy for the mentioned purpose, as long as the training outliers meet certain quality standards. We hypothesize that the outliers in the OE should possess several characteristics simultaneously to be effective in the adversarial training: diversity, and both conceptual differentiability and analogy to the inliers. These aspects seem to play a more critical role in the adversarial setup compared to the standard training. Next, we propose an adaptive OE method to generate near and diverse outliers by incorporating both text and image domain information. This process helps satisfy the mentioned criteria for the generated outliers and significantly enhances the performance of the OE technique, particularly in adversarial settings. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness across various detection setups, such as novelty detection (ND), Open-Set Recognition (OSR), and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of our approach with other OE techniques in adversarial settings to showcase its effectiveness.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="jabbarishiviari2024software" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Software 1.0 Strengths for Interpretability and Data Efficiency <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=gyl8r8ANcd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> (ICLR TinyPapers)</a> </div> <div class="author"> Maral Jabbarishiviari, and Arshia Soltani Moakhar</div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2024 </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%61%72%73%68%69%61.%73%6F%6C%74%61%6E%69%32@%67%6D%61%69%6C.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/ckodser" title="GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://t.me/arshiasol" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fab fa-telegram"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"> </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2024 Arshia Soltani Moakhar. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.6/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-EdPgYcPk/IIrw7FYeuJQexva49pVRZNmt3LculEr7zM=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> </body> </html>
