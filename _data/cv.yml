    - title: Internship in Interpretability and Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks
      institution: Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria)
      year: Feb 2023 - Sep 2023
      description:
        - Supervised by <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh"> Prof. Dan Alistarh </a> <br>
        - Results in "Sparsity-Guided Debugging for Deep Neural Networks" <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04519"> arXiv </a>
        - In this study, we enhanced the performance of various interpretability methods by initially sparsifying the network on a selected sample, followed by the application of the interpretability method. This approach proposes a solution to the challenges presented by polysemantic neurons, which are activated by multiple distinct concepts, allowing for an in-depth investigation into the activation triggers of a neuron on a sample. This is particularly useful when the sample may pertain to a lesser known functionality of the neuron.}

      description:
        - Supervised by <a href="http://sharif.ir/~rohban/"> Prof. Mohammad Hossein Rohban </a>
        - Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection Using GAN Architecture <a \href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/1f6591cc41be737e9ba4cc487ac8082d-Paper-Conference.pdf"> (NeurIPS 2022) </a>
        - Initially, we identified vulnerabilities in existing Robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods to end-to-end adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we proposed a novel OOD detection method, inspired by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture and adversarial training, which achieved state-of-the-art results in robust OOD detection.
        - Aligning Self-Interested Neurons in Deep Neural Networks
        - We explored a scenario where neurons are self-interested, aiming to increase the strength of their connection weights to subsequent layer neurons. We demonstrated that when all neurons rationally update their weights, the resulting behavior closely resembles Gradient Descent. This characteristic enables the training of deeper networks under a self-interested neurons scenario compared to previous approaches, thereby extending the applicability of this method to real-world problems.
