This way then shows that by the up purple circle the information about the united kingdom is already fetched to the model. 
<div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
            {% include figure.html path='assets\img\Can_Large_Language_Models_Explain_Their_Internal_Mechanisms\image10.png' class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        </div>
    </div>
if you replace x with a residual value of some text and model complete is correctly then you can guess that the information is fetched. There is a question this approach can not answer. assume source prompt is united kingdom and investigation prompt is:
Iran: Tehran
France: Paris
x
We have no way of knowing if all information about the united kingdom is already fetched in the residual or only the united kingdom is fetched.
