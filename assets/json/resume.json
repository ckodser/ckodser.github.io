This approach proposes a solution to the challenges presented by polysemantic neurons, which are activated by multiple distinct concepts, allowing for an in-depth investigation into the activation triggers of a neuron on a sample. This is particularly useful when the sample may pertain to a lesser known functionality of the neuron.","highlights":["Sparsity-Guided Debugging for Deep Neural Networks"]},{"name":"Sharif University of Technology","location":"Tehran, Iran","position":"Volunteer (Unpaid) Research Assistant in Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab","startDate":"2021-08-01","endDate":"2024-12-08","prof":"Mohammad Hossein Rohban","url":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/1f6591cc41be737e9ba4cc487ac8082d-Abstract-Conference.html","summary":"Initially, we identified vulnerabilities in existing Robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods to end-to-end adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we proposed a novel OOD detection method, inspired by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture and adversarial training, which achieved state-of-the-art results in robust OOD detection. <br><br>\n\nIn an other work, we explored a scenario where neurons are self-interested, aiming to increase the strength of their connection weights to subsequent layer neurons. We demonstrated that when all neurons rationally update their weights, the resulting behavior closely resembles Gradient Descent. This characteristic enables the training of deeper networks under a self-interested neurons scenario compared to previous approaches, thereby extending the applicability of this method to real-world problems.","highlights":["Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection Using GAN Architecture","Aligning Self-Interested Neurons in Deep Neural Networks"]}],"volunteer":[{"organization":"Summer camp for Iran National Olympiad in Informatics","position":"Main Graph Theory Instructor","startDate":"2021","endDate":"2021","summary":"40 students who are chosen from 10000 students by three exams participate in the summer camp.","highlights":[]},{"organization":"National Team camp for Iran National Olympiad in Informatics","position":"Algorithm Instructor","startDate":"2021","endDate":"2022","summary":"The national team consists of the four chosen students from 10000 students.
